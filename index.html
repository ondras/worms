			This simulation shows a small kingdom of rainbow-hued worms, living in a two-dimensional grid. They travel randomly, but act according to these simple rules:
			<ul>
				<li>Every worm has its (constant) growth speed; it slowly grows longer as it travels.</li>
				<li>When two or more worms (or, more precisely, their heads) meet on a spot, the strongest (longest) worm consumes all other worms, enlarging itself.</li>
				<li>The longer a worm is, the higher is its probability of a complete desintegration. When a worm reaches critical state, it dies and splits into many tiny wormlings.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Simulation speed can be adjusted using a mouse wheel. Toggle individual grid edges by drawing a line across the grid.</b>
